Given: An RNA string s of length at most 80 bp having the same number of occurrences of 'A' as 'U' and the same number of occurrences of 'C' as 'G'.
Return: The total possible number of perfect matchings of basepair edges in the bonding graph of s.

#suppose string is AAUU
#A at pos 0,1; U at pos 2,3
#2 possible matches: 0-2,1-3; 0-3,1-2

#suppose AAAUUU
#A at 0,1,2; U at 3,4,5
#6 possible matches: 3 * 2 * 1 possible matches
#first A matches with any of 3 U locs; second A with any of 2 remaining Us and so on

#For a sequence with n A and U, n! possible matchings
#GC match up independently, so if sequence has x G/C and y A/U
#x! * y ! total matchings
